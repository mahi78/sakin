This is the first public release.
 common contains some common routines that will be used by all
 stack layers. There is also a test driver in here.

 mtp3 - is the start of the mtp3 stack. At this point all there is
 is the start to a decoder/encode.

I'm working on Linux RH7.0 and everything compiles OK.

To try it fire up 2 mtp3 processes using differnet ports

eg
This command starts the process with local port/IP
3000/192.168.2.1 and remote port/IP 3001/192.168.2.1
The -t creates a mesg queue to which the test driver sends
commands

./mtp3 -p3000 -a192.168.2.1 -P3001 -A192.168.2.1 -t 4000

In another x-window

./mtp3 -p3001 -a192.168.2.1 -P3000 -A192.168.2.1 -t 5000

Then in 2 other x-windows start up a couple of test drivers

./driver -t 4000

./driver -t 5000

This presently gets the test driver to tell the stack to send
a TUP message. The stack will send the message to its peer where
it should be decoded and displayed.

Over the next week I'll continue on the mtp3 decoder/encoder and
improve on thi dismal documentation.
